    "# **Near Real-time Plasma Flow Analysis using DSCOVR Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "DSCOVR continues to operate beyond its expected lifespan, occasionally producing hardware faults that may result from space weather events. In this notebook, we analyze raw data from NASA's DSCOVR mission to forecast geomagnetic storms, taking into account hardware faults.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we draw upon prior research, specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [1] [Prominence of the training data preparation in geomagnetic storm prediction using deep neural networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11721-8)\n",
    "- [2] [Prediction of Geomagnetic Storm Using Neural Networks:Comparison of the Efficiency of the Satellite and GroundBased Input Parameters](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/134/1/012041/pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to implement the model in a real-time or near real-time environment, enabling us to process DSCOVR data and make predictions.\n",

    "## Understanding Solar Wind\n",
    "\n",
    "Solar wind frequently interacts with Earth's magnetosphere, leading to geomagnetic storms that can disrupt various technologies, including satellites and electrical power grids. Consequently, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operates a space weather station known as the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR). DSCOVR employs various sensors to facilitate the prediction of these storms by gathering data on the speed, temperature, and density of incoming solar plasma.\n",
    "\n",
    "DSCOVR orbits at a unique location, Lagrange point one, situated 1.5 million kilometers from Earth between the Earth and the Sun. This strategic position allows it to record data on incoming solar plasma before it reaches Earth's vicinity. NOAA leverages this data to simulate the state of Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere, potentially providing early warnings of geomagnetic storms."
